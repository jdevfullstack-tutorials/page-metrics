# Page Metrics Tutorial
GitHub has its own `Traffic` to show unique visitors, views etc.
But, this one is not so useful. First, there is no total views,
as in total from the very start. Second, visitors cannot see
that, compared to YouTube, views are very important 
and its placed there below the video.

Google Analytics is another option. But, first you need
to turn your repo as a web page. Second, the setup
is very tedious. It's really the best way but when it comes
to simplicity, this is not the best.

## The HITS Page Counter Service
So, I did not stop looking for the exact answer. 
Then I discovered HITS service to simply count
the visitors of your page or repo. Every page
hit will be counted and the best thing is
you can embed that in your page or repo README
file.
